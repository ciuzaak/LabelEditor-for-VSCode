# LabelEditor for VSCode

A VS Code extension for annotating images with polygon, rectangle, line, and point shapes, compatible with the LabelMe JSON format. Perfect for creating datasets for machine learning and computer vision projects.

> **Note**: This extension is in early development. Many features are still being refined and improved. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### ONNX Batch Inference (New in v0.11.2)
- **Automated Annotation**: Run ONNX segmentation models on workspace images
  - Access via Tools → 🤖 ONNX Batch Infer
  - Configurable: model directory, Python interpreter, CPU/GPU, RGB/BGR
  - Scope: infer on all images or current image only
  - Existing annotations: skip / merge / overwrite
  - Browse buttons (📂) for path selection via native dialog
  - All settings persist across sessions
  - Progress displayed in VS Code terminal with tqdm
  - Requires: Python with `onnxruntime`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `tqdm`
  - Output: polygon annotations only (currently)

### SAM AI Annotation (New in v0.12.0)
- **Interactive Segmentation**: Annotate with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
  - Enter SAM mode via toolbar button (🧠) or keyboard shortcut (`I`)
  - **Left click**: Positive point prompt
  - **Shift+Left click**: Negative point prompt (requires at least one positive prompt; otherwise Shift starts the eraser, just like in non-SAM modes)
  - **Left click + Drag**: Rectangle (box) prompt
  - **Right click**: Undo last prompt
  - **Double click**: Confirm annotation and enter label
  - **Prompt Combination** (New in v0.15.0): Point and rectangle prompts can coexist; adding a new box replaces only the previous box
  - Real-time mask preview with SVG overlay
  - Lazy encoding: image embedding computed on first interaction for efficiency
  - Supports SAM1 and SAM2 ONNX models with automatic detection
  - Configuration: model directory, Python interpreter, device (CPU/GPU), port
  - All settings persist across sessions
  - SAM service runs as a standalone Python HTTP server in VS Code terminal
  - Requires: Python with `onnxruntime`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`

#### SAM Model Setup
1. Download SAM2 ONNX models from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/vietanhdev/segment-anything-2-onnx-models)
2. Place the encoder and decoder `.onnx` files in the same folder:
   ```
   sam_model/
   ├── encoder.onnx    (or any filename containing "encoder")
   └── decoder.onnx    (or any filename containing "decoder")
   ```
   > If the filenames don't contain "encoder"/"decoder", the service will assume the larger file is the encoder.
3. In VS Code, press `I` to enter SAM mode
4. If the SAM service is not running, a configuration modal will appear — select the model folder and Python interpreter, then click OK to start the service
5. The service runs in a terminal tab and persists until you manually close it

### Eraser Tool (New in v0.13.2)
- **Erase Portions of Annotations**: Remove parts of existing annotations using polygon or rectangle erasers
  - **Shift+Click**: Start a polygon eraser (click to add points, close to apply)
  - **Shift+Long-press+Drag**: Start a rectangle eraser (second click to confirm)
  - Works in all editing modes (Polygon, Rectangle, Line, Point)
  - Boolean subtraction removes the erased area from all overlapping annotations
  - Interior punch-outs are decomposed into hole-free polygons (LabelMe compatible)
  - Right-click or ESC to cancel

### Annotation Merging (New in v0.15.0)
- **Merge Overlapping Instances**: Combine multi-selected polygon/rectangle shapes whose geometries overlap
  - Right-click → **Merge** or `Ctrl+G`
  - Only overlapping pairs are merged; disjoint groups are merged independently; isolated shapes are untouched
  - **All-rectangle selection** → single rectangle (axis-aligned bounding box)
  - **Mixed or any-polygon selection** → polygon (rectangles treated as polygons), via boolean union with holes dropped
  - Mixed labels prompt the user once via the label modal; unanimous-label groups commit silently
  - Single undo step restores all originals

### Image Adjustment (New / expanded in v0.15.0)
- **RGB Channel Selection**: Inspect a single color channel as grayscale (R / G / B) in the ⚙️ Image Adjustment group; lock to preserve across image switches
- **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**: Brighten low-contrast images without color distortion (luminance-only YCbCr); explicit Off/On toggle, clip-limit slider, independent lock

### macOS-Style UI Refresh (New in v0.16.0)
- Toolbar, sidebar, modals, and dropdowns restyled with macOS design tokens — SVG icons replace emoji glyphs, blur-backdrop modals with close (×) button, click-outside-dismiss popovers for the Settings and Tools menus
- Compact `.btn` / `.btn-icon` / `.btn-primary` / `.segmented-*` atoms across mode toggles, theme picker, channel selector, and radio groups
- macOS-style search field with leading icon and inline clear button

### In-Webview Notifications (New in v0.16.0)
- Non-actionable messages (saves, refreshes, exports, ONNX/SAM startup, validation errors) appear inline in the toolbar status area instead of stacking as native VS Code popups; severity-aware colors (info / success / warn / error) with minimum residency so errors are not overwritten before you read them
- Persistent state like `SAM Ready` survives transient interruptions and is restored automatically
- Native dialogs are reserved for prompts that need a Save / Discard / Cancel decision

### Discoverability: Rich Hover Tooltips (New in v0.16.0)
- Every interactive control — buttons, sliders, radios, list-row actions, modal form fields — has a rich tooltip with title, description, and (where applicable) keyboard shortcut
- 500 ms hover delay; clicking does not pop a tooltip; keyboard `Tab` still gets immediate tooltips for accessibility
- Eraser gesture (Shift-click) is documented in every drawing-mode tip

## 📄 Output Format

Annotations are saved in LabelMe JSON format:

\`\`\`json
{
  "version": "5.0.1",
  "flags": {},
  "shapes": [
    {
      "label": "person",
      "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...],
      "group_id": null,
      "shape_type": "polygon",
      "flags": {},
      "description": "optional annotation note"
    }
  ],
  "imagePath": "image.jpg",
  "imageData": null,
  "imageHeight": 1080,
  "imageWidth": 1920
}
\`\`\`

Note: `visible` property is not saved to JSON - it's a session-only UI state. `description` is only included when non-empty.

## 🛠️ Known Limitations

This extension is still under active development. Some known limitations include:

- No support for circle/ellipse shape types yet
- No import from other formats
- Performance may degrade with very large images (10000x10000+)
- No support for video frame annotation
- SAM mode requires a local Python environment with ONNX Runtime
