## 📄 Output Format

Annotations are saved in LabelMe JSON format:

\`\`\`json
{
  "version": "5.0.1",
  "flags": {},
  "shapes": [
    {
      "label": "person",
      "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...],
      "group_id": null,
      "shape_type": "polygon",
      "flags": {}
    }
  ],
  "imagePath": "image.jpg",
  "imageData": null,
  "imageHeight": 1080,
  "imageWidth": 1920
}
\`\`\`

Note: `visible` property is not saved to JSON - it's a session-only UI state.

## 🛠️ Known Limitations

This extension is still under active development. Some known limitations include:

- No support for other shape types (rectangles, circles, etc.) yet
- No batch annotation features
- No import from other formats
- Performance may degrade with very large images (10000x10000+)
- No support for video frame annotation

## 🤖 Development

**All code in this extension was written by AI:**
- **Gemini 3 Pro**
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**

This project serves as a demonstration of AI-assisted development capabilities.
