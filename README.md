    {
      "label": "person",
      "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...],
      "group_id": null,
      "shape_type": "polygon",
      "flags": {},
      "visible": true

## 🛠️ Known Limitations

This extension is still under active development. Some known limitations include:

- No support for other shape types (rectangles, circles, etc.) yet
- Limited undo/redo functionality (removed for stability)
- No batch annotation features
- No import from other formats
- Performance may degrade with very large images or many annotations
- No support for video frame annotation

## 🤖 Development

**All code in this extension was written by AI:**
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental**
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**

This project serves as a demonstration of AI-assisted development capabilities.

## 📝 Roadmap

Planned features for future releases:

- [ ] Undo/Redo support
- [ ] Rectangle and circle shapes
- [ ] Batch annotation mode
- [ ] Export to other formats (COCO, YOLO, etc.)
- [ ] Image pre-processing (brightness, contrast)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts customization
- [ ] Multi-language support
